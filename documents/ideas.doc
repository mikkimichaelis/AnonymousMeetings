/////////////////////////////////////
I wrote this app for the still suffering addict.

I just spend 3 weeks in rehab, then spend 5 weeks in residential
treatment with my MacBook Pro writing this app.  I was ejected
from the facility and then spent 1 month and 1 day in cheap motels.

I am now home with family.

Writing this app has kept me sober so far.  This app is intended
to help a person quickly and easily find help.

I wrote this app because I am that still suffering addict.
